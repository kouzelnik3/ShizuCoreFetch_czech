## 📖 Overview

**Shizu CoreFetch** is a next‑generation application manager for Android that leverages the **Shizuku** API to perform silent installs, uninstalls, and background updates without requiring root access. It comes bundled with a local **APK wallet**, a centralized repository browser, GitHub authentication, and real‑time notifications — all wrapped in a clean, modern interface that supports light/dark themes and 9 languages.

> ⚡ Perfect for power users, developers, and anyone tired of manual package management.

---

> ⚠️ **Notice for Developers:** The source code currently available in this repository reflects stable version **1.0.0**. The latest ecosystem features of version **1.2.0** (such as Zero-Quota Architecture, the Comment System, App Ratings, and Whitelisted Banner Ads) are currently available exclusively in the compiled APK on the [Releases](https://github.com/elhizazi1/ShizuCoreFetch/releases) page. The repository source code will be fully synced soon.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Silent Operations with Shizuku:** Install, uninstall, and update apps directly at system level — fully supports both **Root** and Wireless Debugging (**ADB**).
- **Zero-Quota Architecture:** Browse and download seamlessly without hitting GitHub API rate limits. The store handles high traffic effortlessly.
- **Centralized Repository:** Browse and fetch applications from a curated repository. Each app includes screenshots, description, developer info, and version history.
- **Local Storage Wallet:** Store downloaded APKs locally, share them via any app, or open them with external file viewers. Delete packages with a single tap to free up space.
- **Update Notifications:** Receive alerts when new versions of your installed apps become available. Background checks ensure you never miss an update.
- **GitHub Integration:** Sign in with your GitHub account or continue as a guest. Your installed apps and update status are tied to your profile (optional).
- **Multi‑Language:** Available in 11 languages: العربية, English, Français, Español, Português, Русский, हिन्दी, 中文, 日本語, Türkçe, Čeština.
- **Dynamic Theming:** Switch between Light, Dark, and System‑follow modes on the fly.
- **Privacy First:** 100% offline‑first architecture. No tracking, no analytics, no data collection. Your apps and data stay on your device.

## 📦 Requirements

- Android 8.0+ (API 26)
- [Shizuku](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moe.shizuku.privileged.api) installed and running on your device
- Network permission (for fetching app data from the repository)
- Storage permission (for saving and sharing APK files)

> Root access is **not** required.

---

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Download the latest APK** from the [Releases page](https://github.com/elhizazi1/ShizuCoreFetch/releases/latest).
2. Install the APK on your Android device (you may need to allow “Install from unknown sources”).
3. Open **Shizuku** and start the service.
4. Launch **Shizu CoreFetch** → grant the Shizuku permission when prompted.
5. You’re all set! Browse the repository or use the wallet to manage your packages.

## 🧠 How It Works

Shizu CoreFetch uses the Shizuku Binder API to execute privileged commands directly on the Android package manager. This enables:

- **Silent install** (`pm install`)
- **Silent uninstall** (`pm uninstall`)
- **Background updates** without any pop‑ups

The app itself runs without root, making it safe and compliant with modern Android security policies.

## Acknowledgments & Design Assets

The user interface of Shizu CoreFetch relies on clean and professional iconography. The icons used throughout the application are sourced from the **[Iconsax](https://github.com/glenthemes/iconsax/tree/gh-pages)** library. To ensure optimal performance, crisp scaling across all screen densities, and memory efficiency on Android, all utilized icons were converted from their original formats into native Android Vector Drawable (XML) formats.
